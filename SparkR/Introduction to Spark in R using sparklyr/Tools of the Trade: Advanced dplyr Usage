Q1:-
A Spark connection has been created for you as spark_conn. A tibble attached to the track metadata stored in Spark has been pre-defined as track_metadata_tbl.

Select all columns from track_metadata_tbl starting with "artist".
Select all columns from track_metadata_tbl ending with "id"

Solution:-
# track_metadata_tbl has been pre-defined
track_metadata_tbl

track_metadata_tbl %>%
  # Select columns starting with artist
  select(starts_with('artist'))

track_metadata_tbl %>%
  # Select columns ending with id
  select(ends_with('id'))

Q2:-
A Spark connection has been created for you as spark_conn. A tibble attached to the track metadata stored in Spark has been pre-defined as track_metadata_tbl.

Select all columns from track_metadata_tbl containing "ti".
Select all columns from track_metadata_tbl matching the regular expression "ti.?t".

Solution:-
# track_metadata_tbl has been pre-defined
track_metadata_tbl

track_metadata_tbl %>%
  # Select columns containing ti
  select(contains('ti'))

track_metadata_tbl %>%
  # Select columns matching ti.?t
  select(matches("ti.?t"))

Q3:-
A Spark connection has been created for you as spark_conn. A tibble attached to the track metadata stored in Spark has been pre-defined as track_metadata_tbl.
Find the distinct values of the artist_name column from track_metadata_tbl.

Solution:-
# track_metadata_tbl has been pre-defined
track_metadata_tbl

track_metadata_tbl %>%
  # Only return rows with distinct artist_name
  distinct(artist_name)

Q4:-
A Spark connection has been created for you as spark_conn. A tibble attached to the track metadata stored in Spark has been pre-defined as track_metadata_tbl.

Count the values in the artist_name column from track_metadata_tbl.
Pass sort = TRUE to sort the rows by descending popularity.
Restrict the results to the top 20 using top_n().

Solution:-
# track_metadata_tbl has been pre-defined
track_metadata_tbl

track_metadata_tbl %>%
  # Count the artist_name values
  count(artist_name,sort=TRUE) %>%
  # Restrict to top 20
  top_n(n=20)
  
Q5:-
A Spark connection has been created for you as spark_conn. A tibble attached to the track metadata stored in Spark has been pre-defined as track_metadata_tbl.

Filter the rows of track_metadata_tbl where artist_familiarity is greater than 0.9, assigning the results to results.
Print the class of results, noting that it is a tbl_lazy (used for remote data).
Collect your results, assigning them to collected.
Print the class of collected, noting that it is a tbl_df (used for local data).

Solution:-
