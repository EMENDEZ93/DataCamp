Q1:-
Which of these statements is true?

sparklyr's dplyr methods convert code into Scala code before running it on Spark.
Converting R code into SQL code limits the number of supported computations.
Most Spark MLlib modeling functions require DoubleType inputs and return DoubleType outputs.
Most Spark MLlib modeling functions require IntegerType inputs and return BooleanType outputs

Solution:-
2 and 3.

Q2:-
A Spark connection has been created for you as spark_conn. A tibble attached to the track metadata stored in Spark has been pre-defined as track_metadata_tbl.

Create a variable named hotttnesss from track_metadata_tbl.
Select the artist_hotttnesss field.
Use ft_binarizer() to create a new field, is_hottt_or_nottt, which is true when artist_hotttnesss is greater than 0.5.
Collect the result.
Convert the is_hottt_or_nottt field to be logical.
Draw a ggplot() bar plot of is_hottt_or_nottt.
The first argument to ggplot() is the data argument, hotttnesss.
The second argument to ggplot() is the aesthetic, is_hottt_or_nottt wrapped in aes().
Add geom_bar() to draw the bars.

Solution:-
