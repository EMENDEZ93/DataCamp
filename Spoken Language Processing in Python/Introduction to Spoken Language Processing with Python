Q1:-
Import the Python wave library.
Read in the good_morning.wav audio file and save it to good_morning.
Create signal_gm by reading all the frames from good_morning using readframes().
See what the first 10 frames of audio look like by slicing signal_gm.

Solution:-
import wave

# Create audio file wave object
good_morning = wave.open("good_morning.wav", 'r')

# Read all frames from wave object 
signal_gm = good_morning.readframes(-1)

# View first 10
print(signal_gm[:10])
