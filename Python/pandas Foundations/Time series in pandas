Q1:-
Prepare a format string, time_format, using '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M' as the desired format.
Convert date_list into a datetime object by using the pd.to_datetime() function. 
Specify the format string you defined above and assign the result to my_datetimes.
Construct a pandas Series called time_series using pd.Series() with temperature_list and my_datetimes. 
Set the index of the Series to be my_datetimes.

Solution:-
# Prepare a format string: time_format
time_format = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'

# Convert date_list into a datetime object: my_datetimes
my_datetimes = pd.to_datetime(date_list, format=time_format)  

# Construct a pandas Series using temperature_list and my_datetimes: time_series
time_series = pd.Series(temperature_list, index=my_datetimes)

Q2:-
Extract data from ts0 for a single hour - the hour from 9pm to 10pm on 2010-10-11. Assign it to ts1.
Extract data from ts0 for a single day - July 4th, 2010 - and assign it to ts2.
Extract data from ts0 for the second half of December 2010 - 12/15/2010 to 12/31/2010. Assign it to ts3.

Solution:-
# Extract the hour from 9pm to 10pm on '2010-10-11': ts1
ts1 = ts0.loc['2010-10-11 21:00:00':'2010-10-11 22:00:00']

# Extract '2010-07-04' from ts0: ts2
ts2 = ts0.loc['2010-07-04']

# Extract data from '2010-12-15' to '2010-12-31': ts3
ts3 = ts0.loc['2010-12-15':'2010-12-31']

Q3:-
Create a new time series ts3 by reindexing ts2 with the index of ts1. To do this, call .reindex() on ts2 and pass in the index of ts1 (ts1.index).
Create another new time series, ts4, by calling the same .reindex() as above, but also specifiying a fill method, using the keyword argument method="ffill" to forward-fill values.
Add ts1 + ts2. Assign the result to sum12.
Add ts1 + ts3. Assign the result to sum13.
Add ts1 + ts4, Assign the result to sum14.

Solution:-
# Reindex without fill method: ts3
ts3 = ts2.reindex(ts1.index)

# Reindex with fill method, using forward fill: ts4
ts4 = ts2.reindex(ts1.index, method="ffill")

# Combine ts1 + ts2: sum12
sum12 = ts1+ts2

# Combine ts1 + ts3: sum13
sum13 = ts1+ts3

# Combine ts1 + ts4: sum14
sum14 = ts1+ts4

Q4:-
Downsample the 'Temperature' column of df to 6 hour data using .resample('6h') and .mean(). Assign the result to df1.
Downsample the 'Temperature' column of df to daily data using .resample('D') and then count the number of data points in each day with .count(). Assign the result df2.

Solution:-
# Downsample to 6 hour data and aggregate by mean: df1
df1 = df['Temperature'].resample('6h').mean()

# Downsample to daily data and count the number of data points: df2
df2 = df['Temperature'].resample('D').count()

Q5:-
Use partial string indexing to extract temperature data for August 2010 into august.
Use the temperature data for August and downsample to find the daily maximum temperatures. Store the result in august_highs.
Use partial string indexing to extract temperature data for February 2010 into february.
Use the temperature data for February and downsample to find the daily minimum temperatures. Store the result in february_lows.

Solution:-
# Extract temperature data for August: august
august = df['Temperature']['August 2010']

# Downsample to obtain only the daily highest temperatures in August: august_highs
august_highs = august.resample('D').max()

# Extract temperature data for February: february
february = df['Temperature']['February 2010']

# Downsample to obtain the daily lowest temperatures in February: february_lows
february_lows = february.resample('D').min()

Q6:-
Use partial string indexing to extract temperature data from August 1 2010 to August 15 2010. Assign to unsmoothed.
Use .rolling() with a 24 hour window to smooth the mean temperature data. Assign the result to smoothed.
Use a dictionary to create a new DataFrame august with the time series smoothed and unsmoothed as columns.
Plot both the columns of august as line plots using the .plot() method.

Solution:-
# Extract data from 2010-Aug-01 to 2010-Aug-15: unsmoothed
unsmoothed = df['Temperature']['2010-Aug-01':'2010-Aug-15']

# Apply a rolling mean with a 24 hour window: smoothed
smoothed = unsmoothed.rolling(window=24).mean()

# Create a new DataFrame with columns smoothed and unsmoothed: august
august = pd.DataFrame({'smoothed':smoothed, 'unsmoothed':unsmoothed})

# Plot both smoothed and unsmoothed data using august.plot().
august.plot()
plt.show()

Q7:-
Use partial string indexing to extract August 2010 temperature data, and assign to august.
Resample to daily frequency, saving the maximum daily temperatures, and assign the result to daily_highs.
As part of one long method chain, repeat the above resampling (or you can re-use daily_highs) and then combine it with .rolling() to apply a 7 day .mean() (with window=7 inside .rolling()) so as to smooth the daily highs. Assign the result to daily_highs_smoothed and print the result.

Solution:-
# Extract the August 2010 data: august
august = df['Temperature']['August 2010']

# Resample to daily data, aggregating by max: daily_highs
daily_highs = august.resample('D').max()

# Use a rolling 7-day window with method chaining to smooth the daily high temperatures in August
daily_highs_smoothed = daily_highs.rolling(window=7).mean()
print(daily_highs_smoothed)
