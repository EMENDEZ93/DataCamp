Q1:-
Import the function urlretrieve from the subpackage urllib.request.
Assign the URL of the file to the variable url.
Use the function urlretrieve() to save the file locally as 'winequality-red.csv'.
Execute the remaining code to load 'winequality-red.csv' in a pandas DataFrame and to print its head to the shell.

Solution:-
# Import package
from urllib.request import urlretrieve

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd
import os
# Assign url of file: url
url = 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'

# Save file locally
urlretrieve(url, 'winequality-red.csv')

# Read file into a DataFrame and print its head
df = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv', sep=';')
print(df.head())

Q2:-
Assign the URL of the file to the variable url.
Read file into a DataFrame df using pd.read_csv(), recalling that the separator in the file is ';'.
Print the head of the DataFrame df.
Execute the rest of the code to plot histogram of the first feature in the DataFrame df.

Solution:-
# Import packages
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from urllib.request import urlretrieve
# Assign url of file: url
url = 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'

# Save file locally
urlretrieve(url, 'winequality-red.csv')

# Read file into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv', sep=';')

# Print the head of the DataFrame
print(df.head())

# Plot first column of df
pd.DataFrame.hist(df.ix[:, 0:1])
plt.xlabel('fixed acidity (g(tartaric acid)/dm$^3$)')
plt.ylabel('count')
plt.show()


Q3:-
Assign the URL of the file to the variable url.
Read the file in url into a dictionary xl using pd.read_excel() recalling that, in order to import all sheets you need to pass None to the argument sheetname.
Print the names of the sheets in the Excel spreadsheet; these will be the keys of the dictionary xl.
Print the head of the first sheet using the sheet name, not the index of the sheet! The sheet name is '1700'
