Q1:-
Import KMeans from sklearn.cluster.
Using KMeans(), create a KMeans instance called model to find 3 clusters. To specify the number of clusters, use the n_clusters keyword argument.
Use the .fit() method of model to fit the model to the array of points points.
Use the .predict() method of model to predict the cluster labels of new_points, assigning the result to labels.
Hit 'Submit Answer' to see the cluster labels of new_points.

Solution:-
# Import KMeans
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Create a KMeans instance with 3 clusters: model
model = KMeans(n_clusters=3)

# Fit model to points
model.fit(points)

# Determine the cluster labels of new_points: labels
labels = model.predict(new_points)

# Print cluster labels of new_points
print(labels)

Q2:-

Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
Assign column 0 of new_points to xs, and column 1 of new_points to ys.
Make a scatter plot of xs and ys, specifying the c=labels keyword arguments to color the points by their cluster label. Also specify alpha=0.5.
Compute the coordinates of the centroids using the .cluster_centers_ attribute of model.
Assign column 0 of centroids to centroids_x, and column 1 of centroids to centroids_y.
Make a scatter plot of centroids_x and centroids_y, using 'D' (a diamond) as a marker by specifying the marker parameter. Set the size of the markers to be 50 using s=50.

Solution:-
# Import pyplot
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Assign the columns of new_points: xs and ys
xs = new_points[:,0]
ys = new_points[:,1]

# Make a scatter plot of xs and ys, using labels to define the colors
plt.scatter(xs,ys,c=labels,alpha=0.5)

# Assign the cluster centers: centroids
centroids = model.cluster_centers_

# Assign the columns of centroids: centroids_x, centroids_y
centroids_x = centroids[:,0]
centroids_y = centroids[:,1]

# Make a scatter plot of centroids_x and centroids_y
plt.scatter(centroids_x,centroids_y,marker='D',s=50)
plt.show()

Q3:-
For each of the given values of k, perform the following steps:
Create a KMeans instance called model with k clusters.
Fit the model to the grain data samples.
Append the value of the inertia_ attribute of model to the list inertias.
The code to plot ks vs inertias has been written for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the plot!

Solution:-
ks = range(1, 6)
inertias = []

for k in ks:
    # Create a KMeans instance with k clusters: model
    model = KMeans(n_clusters=k)
    
    # Fit model to samples
    model.fit(samples)
    
    # Append the inertia to the list of inertias
    inertias.append(model.inertia_)
    
# Plot ks vs inertias
plt.plot(ks, inertias, '-o')
plt.xlabel('number of clusters, k')
plt.ylabel('inertia')
plt.xticks(ks)
plt.show()

Q4:-
Create a KMeans model called model with 3 clusters.
Use the .fit_predict() method of model to fit it to samples and derive the cluster labels. Using .fit_predict() is the same as using .fit() followed by .predict().
Create a DataFrame df with two columns named 'labels' and 'varieties', using labels and varieties, respectively, for the column values. This has been done for you.
Use the pd.crosstab() function on df['labels'] and df['varieties'] to count the number of times each grain variety coincides with each cluster label. Assign the result to ct.
Hit 'Submit Answer' to see the cross-tabulation!

Solution:-
# Create a KMeans model with 3 clusters: model
model = KMeans(n_clusters=3)

# Use fit_predict to fit model and obtain cluster labels: labels
labels = model.fit_predict(samples)

# Create a DataFrame with labels and varieties as columns: df
df = pd.DataFrame({'labels': labels, 'varieties': varieties})

# Create crosstab: ct
ct = pd.crosstab(df['labels'],df['varieties'])

# Display ct
print(ct)

Q5:-
Import:
make_pipeline from sklearn.pipeline.
StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing.
KMeans from sklearn.cluster.
Create an instance of StandardScaler called scaler.
Create an instance of KMeans with 4 clusters called kmeans.
Create a pipeline called pipeline that chains scaler and kmeans. To do this, you just need to pass them in as arguments to make_pipeline().

Solution:-
# Perform the necessary imports
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Create scaler: scaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Create KMeans instance: kmeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4)

# Create pipeline: pipeline
pipeline = make_pipeline(scaler,kmeans)

Q6:-
Import pandas as pd.
Fit the pipeline to the fish measurements samples.
Obtain the cluster labels for samples by using the .predict() method of pipeline.
Using pd.DataFrame(), create a DataFrame df with two columns named 'labels' and 'species', using labels and species, respectively, for the column values.
Using pd.crosstab(), create a cross-tabulation ct of df['labels'] and df['species'].

Solution:-
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Fit the pipeline to samples
pipeline.fit(samples)

# Calculate the cluster labels: labels
labels = pipeline.predict(samples)

# Create a DataFrame with labels and species as columns: df
df = pd.DataFrame({'labels':labels,'species':species})

# Create crosstab: ct
ct = pd.crosstab(df['labels'],df['species'])

# Display ct
print(ct)

Q7:-
Import Normalizer from sklearn.preprocessing.
Create an instance of Normalizer called normalizer.
Create an instance of KMeans called kmeans with 10 clusters.
Using make_pipeline(), create a pipeline called pipeline that chains normalizer and kmeans.
Fit the pipeline to the movements array.

Solution:-
# Import Normalizer
from sklearn.preprocessing import Normalizer

# Create a normalizer: normalizer
normalizer = Normalizer()

# Create a KMeans model with 10 clusters: kmeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=10)

# Make a pipeline chaining normalizer and kmeans: pipeline
pipeline = make_pipeline(normalizer,kmeans)

# Fit pipeline to the daily price movements
pipeline.fit(movements)

Q8:-
Import pandas as pd.
Use the .predict() method of the pipeline to predict the labels for movements.
Align the cluster labels with the list of company names companies by creating a DataFrame df with labels and companies as columns. This has been done for you.
Use the .sort_values() method of df to sort the DataFrame by the 'labels' column, and print the result.
Hit 'Submit Answer' and take a moment to see which companies are together in each cluster!

Solution:-
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Predict the cluster labels: labels
labels = pipeline.predict(movements)

# Create a DataFrame aligning labels and companies: df
df = pd.DataFrame({'labels': labels, 'companies': companies})

# Display df sorted by cluster label
print(df.sort_values(by='labels'))
