Q1:-
Import matplotlib.pyplot as its usual alias.
Add a 'blue' line plot of the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences (physical_sciences) from 1970 to 2011 (year). Note that the x-axis should be specified first.
Add a 'red' line plot of the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science (computer_science) from 1970 to 2011 (year).
Use plt.show() to display the figure with the curves on the same axes.

Solution:-
# Import matplotlib.pyplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot in blue the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue')

# Plot in red the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science
plt.plot(year,computer_science,color='red')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Q2:-
Create a set of plot axes with lower corner xlo and ylo of 0.05 and 0.05, width of 0.425, and height of 0.9 (in units relative to the figure dimension).
Note: Remember to pass these coordinates to plt.axes() in the form of a list: [xlo, ylo, width, height].
Plot the percentage of degrees awarded to women in Physical Sciences in blue in the active axes just created.
Create a set of plot axes with lower corner xlo and ylo of 0.525 and 0.05, width of 0.425, and height of 0.9 (in units relative to the figure dimension).
Plot the percentage of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science in red in the active axes just created.

Solution:-
# Create plot axes for the first line plot
plt.axes([0.05,0.05,0.425,0.9])

# Plot in blue the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue')

# Create plot axes for the second line plot
plt.axes([0.525,0.05,0.425,0.9])

# Plot in red the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science
plt.plot(year,computer_science,color='red')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Q3:-
Use plt.subplot() to create a figure with 1x2 subplot layout & make the first subplot active.
Plot the percentage of degrees awarded to women in Physical Sciences in blue in the active subplot.
Use plt.subplot() again to make the second subplot active in the current 1x2 subplot grid.
Plot the percentage of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science in red in the active subplot.

Solution:-
# Create a figure with 1x2 subplot and make the left subplot active
plt.subplot(1,2,1)

# Plot in blue the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue')
plt.title('Physical Sciences')

# Make the right subplot active in the current 1x2 subplot grid
plt.subplot(1,2,2)

# Plot in red the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science
plt.plot(year, computer_science, color='red')
plt.title('Computer Science')

# Use plt.tight_layout() to improve the spacing between subplots
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Q4:-
Create a figure with 2×2 subplot layout, make the top, left subplot active, and plot the % of degrees awarded to women in Physical Sciences in blue in the active subplot.
Make the top, right subplot active in the current 2×2 subplot grid and plot the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science in red in the active subplot.
Make the bottom, left subplot active in the current 2×2 subplot grid and plot the % of degrees awarded to women in Health Professions in green in the active subplot.
Make the bottom, right subplot active in the current 2×2 subplot grid and plot the % of degrees awarded to women in Education in yellow in the active subplot.

Solution:-
# Create a figure with 2x2 subplot layout and make the top left subplot active
plt.subplot(2,2,1)

# Plot in blue the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue')
plt.title('Physical Sciences')

# Make the top right subplot active in the current 2x2 subplot grid 
plt.subplot(2,2,2)

# Plot in red the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science
plt.plot(year, computer_science, color='red')
plt.title('Computer Science')

# Make the bottom left subplot active in the current 2x2 subplot grid
plt.subplot(2,2,3)

# Plot in green the % of degrees awarded to women in Health Professions
plt.plot(year, health, color='green')
plt.title('Health Professions')

# Make the bottom right subplot active in the current 2x2 subplot grid
plt.subplot(2,2,4)

# Plot in yellow the % of degrees awarded to women in Education
plt.plot(year, education, color='yellow')
plt.title('Education')

# Improve the spacing between subplots and display them
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Q5:-
Use plt.xlim() to set the x-axis range to the period between the years 1990 and 2010.
Use plt.ylim() to set the y-axis range to the interval between 0% and 50% of degrees awarded.
Display the final figure with plt.show() and save the output to 'xlim_and_ylim.png'.

Solution:-
# Plot the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science and the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year,computer_science, color='red') 
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue')

# Add the axis labels
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Degrees awarded to women (%)')

# Set the x-axis range
plt.xlim([1990,2010])

# Set the y-axis range
plt.ylim([0,50])

# Add a title and display the plot
plt.title('Degrees awarded to women (1990-2010)\nComputer Science (red)\nPhysical Sciences (blue)')
plt.show()

# Save the image as 'xlim_and_ylim.png'
plt.savefig('xlim_and_ylim.png')

Q6:-
Use plt.axis() to select the time period between 1990 and 2010 on the x-axis as well as the interval between 0 and 50% awarded on the y-axis.
Save the resulting plot as 'axis_limits.png'.

Solution:-
# Plot in blue the % of degrees awarded to women in Computer Science
plt.plot(year,computer_science, color='blue')

# Plot in red the % of degrees awarded to women in the Physical Sciences
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences,color='red')

# Set the x-axis and y-axis limits
plt.axis([1990,2010,0,50])

# Show the figure
plt.show()

# Save the figure as 'axis_limits.png'
plt.savefig('axis_limits.png')

Q7:-
Modify the plot command provided that draws the enrollment of women in Computer Science over time so that the curve is labelled 'Computer Science' in the legend.
Modify the plot command provided that draws the enrollment of women in the Physical Sciences over time so that the curve is labelled 'Physical Sciences' in the legend.
Add a legend at the lower center (i.e., loc='lower center').

Solution:-
# Specify the label 'Computer Science'
plt.plot(year, computer_science, color='red', label='Computer Science') 

# Specify the label 'Physical Sciences' 
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue', label='Physical Sciences')

# Add a legend at the lower center
plt.legend(loc='lower center')

# Add axis labels and title
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Enrollment (%)')
plt.title('Undergraduate enrollment of women')
plt.show()

Q8:-
Compute the maximum enrollment of women in Computer Science using the .max() method.
Calculate the year in which there was maximum enrollment of women in Computer Science using the .argmax() method.
Annotate the plot with an arrow at the point of peak women enrolling in Computer Science.
Label the arrow 'Maximum'. The parameter for this is s, but you don't have to specify it.
Pass in the arguments to xy and xytext as tuples.
For xy, use the yr_max and cs_max that you computed.
For xytext, use (yr_max+5, cs_max+5) to specify the displacement of the label from the tip of the arrow.
Draw the arrow by specifying the keyword argument arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black'). The single letter shortcut for 'black' is 'k'.

Solution:-
# Plot with legend as before
plt.plot(year, computer_science, color='red', label='Computer Science') 
plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue', label='Physical Sciences')
plt.legend(loc='lower right')

# Compute the maximum enrollment of women in Computer Science: cs_max
cs_max = computer_science.max()

# Calculate the year in which there was maximum enrollment of women in Computer Science: yr_max
yr_max = year[computer_science.argmax()]

# Add a black arrow annotation
plt.annotate('Maximum',xy=(yr_max,cs_max),xytext=(yr_max+5, cs_max+5),arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black'))

# Add axis labels and title
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Enrollment (%)')
plt.title('Undergraduate enrollment of women')
plt.show()

Q9:-
Import matplotlib.pyplot as its usual alias.
Activate the 'ggplot' style sheet with plt.style.use().

Solution:-
# Import matplotlib.pyplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set the style to 'ggplot'
plt.style.use('ggplot')

# Create a figure with 2x2 subplot layout
plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)

plt.plot(year, physical_sciences, color='blue')
plt.title('Physical Sciences')

# Plot the enrollment % of women in Computer Science
plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)

plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
plt.plot(year, health, color='green')
plt.title('Health Professions')

# Plot the enrollment % of women in Education
plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
