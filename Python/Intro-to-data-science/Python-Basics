Q1:-
Experiment in the IPython Shell; type 5 / 8, for example.
Add another line of code to the Python script: print(7 + 10).

Solution:-
# Example, do not modify!
print(5 / 8)

# Put code below here
print(7 + 10)

Q2:-
Suppose you have $100, which you can invest with a 10% return each year. After one year, it's 100×1.1=110100×1.1=110 dollars, and after two years it's 100×1.1×1.1=121100×1.1×1.1=121. 
Add code on the right to calculate how much money you end up with after 7 years.

Solution:-
# Addition and subtraction
print(5 + 5)
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication and division
print(3 * 5)
print(10 / 2)

# Exponentiation
print(4 ** 2)

# Modulo
print(18 % 7)

# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?
print(100*1.1**7)

Q3:-
Calculate the product of savings and factor. Store the result in year1.
What do you think the resulting type will be? Find out by printing out the type of year1.
Calculate the sum of desc and desc and store the result in a new variable doubledesc.
Print out doubledesc. Did you expect this?

Solution:-
# Several variables to experiment with
savings = 100
factor = 1.1
desc = "compound interest"

# Assign product of factor and savings to year1
year1 = factor * savings

# Print the type of year1
print(type(year1))

# Assign sum of desc and desc to doubledesc
doubledesc = desc + desc

# Print out doubledesc
print(doubledesc)

Q4:-
Fix the code on the right such that the printout runs without errors; use the function str() to convert the variables to strings.
Convert the variable pi_string to a float and store this float as a new variable, pi_float.

Solution:-
# Definition of savings and result
savings = 100
result = 100 * 1.10 ** 7

# Fix the printout
print("I started with $" + str(savings) + " and now have $" + str(result) + ". Awesome!")

# Definition of pi_string
pi_string = "3.1415926"

# Convert pi_string into float: pi_float
pi_float = float(pi_string)
