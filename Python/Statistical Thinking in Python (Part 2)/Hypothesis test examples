Q1:-
Construct Boolean arrays, dems and reps that contain the votes of the respective parties; e.g., dems has 153 True entries and 91 False entries.
Write a function, frac_yea_dems(dems, reps) that returns the fraction of Democrats that voted yea. The first input is an array of Booleans, Two inputs are required to use your draw_perm_reps() function, but the second is not used.
Use your draw_perm_reps() function to draw 10,000 permutation replicates of the fraction of Democrat yea votes.
Compute and print the p-value.

Solution:-
# Construct arrays of data: dems, reps
dems = np.array([True] * 153 + [False] * 91)
reps = np.array([True]* 136 + [False]*35)

def frac_yea_dems(dems, reps):
    """Compute fraction of Democrat yea votes."""
    frac = np.sum(dems) / len(dems)
    return frac

# Acquire permutation samples: perm_replicates
perm_replicates = draw_perm_reps(dems, reps, frac_yea_dems, size=10000)

# Compute and print p-value: p
p = np.sum(perm_replicates <= 153/244) / len(perm_replicates)
print('p-value =', p)

Q2:-
Compute the observed difference in mean inter-nohitter time using diff_of_means().
Generate 10,000 permutation replicates of the difference of means using draw_perm_reps().
Compute and print the p-value.

Solution:-
# Compute the observed difference in mean inter-no-hitter times: nht_diff_obs
nht_diff_obs = diff_of_means(nht_dead,nht_live)

# Acquire 10,000 permutation replicates of difference in mean no-hitter time: perm_replicates
perm_replicates = draw_perm_reps(nht_dead,nht_live,diff_of_means,size=10000)


# Compute and print the p-value: p
p = np.sum(perm_replicates <= nht_diff_obs)/len(perm_replicates)
print('p-val =', p)

Q3:-
Compute the observed Pearson correlation between illiteracy and fertility.
Initialize an array to store your permutation replicates.
Write a for loop to draw 10,000 replicates:
Permute the illiteracy measurements using np.random.permutation().
Compute the Pearson correlation between the permuted illiteracy array, illiteracy_permuted, and fertility.
Compute and print the p-value from the replicates.

Solution:-
# Compute observed correlation: r_obs
r_obs = pearson_r(illiteracy,fertility)

# Initialize permutation replicates: perm_replicates
perm_replicates = np.empty(10000)

# Draw replicates
for i in range(10000):
    # Permute illiteracy measurments: illiteracy_permuted
    illiteracy_permuted = np.random.permutation(illiteracy)

    # Compute Pearson correlation
    perm_replicates[i] = pearson_r(illiteracy_permuted,fertility)

# Compute p-value: p
p = np.sum(perm_replicates >= 1)/len(perm_replicates)
print('p-val =', p)
