Q1:-
Using pd.merge(), merge the DataFrames revenue and managers on the 'city' column of each. Store the result as merge_by_city.
Print the DataFrame merge_by_city. This has been done for you.
Merge the DataFrames revenue and managers on the 'branch_id' column of each. Store the result as merge_by_id.
Print the DataFrame merge_by_id. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result!

Solution:-
# Merge revenue with managers on 'city': merge_by_city
merge_by_city = pd.merge(revenue,managers,on='city')

# Print merge_by_city
print(merge_by_city)

# Merge revenue with managers on 'branch_id': merge_by_id
merge_by_id = pd.merge(revenue,managers,on='branch_id')

# Print merge_by_id
print(merge_by_id)

Q2:-
Merge the DataFrames revenue and managers into a single DataFrame called combined using the 'city' and 'branch' columns from the appropriate DataFrames.
In your call to pd.merge(), you will have to specify the parameters left_on and right_on appropriately.
Print the new DataFrame combined.

Solution:-
# Merge revenue & managers on 'city' & 'branch': combined
combined = pd.merge(revenue,managers,left_on='city',right_on='branch')

# Print combined
print(combined)

Q3:-
Create a column called 'state' in the DataFrame revenue, consisting of the list ['TX','CO','IL','CA'].
Create a column called 'state' in the DataFrame managers, consisting of the list ['TX','CO','CA','MO'].
Merge the DataFrames revenue and managers using three columns :'branch_id', 'city', and 'state'. Pass them in as a list to the on paramater of pd.merge().

Solution:-
# Add 'state' column to revenue: revenue['state']
revenue['state'] = ['TX','CO','IL','CA']

# Add 'state' column to managers: managers['state']
managers['state'] = ['TX','CO','CA','MO']

# Merge revenue & managers on 'branch_id', 'city', & 'state': combined
combined = pd.merge(revenue,managers,on=['branch_id', 'city', 'state'])

# Print combined
print(combined)

Q4:-
Execute a right merge using pd.merge() with revenue and sales to yield a new DataFrame revenue_and_sales.
Use how='right' and on=['city', 'state'].
Print the new DataFrame revenue_and_sales. This has been done for you.
Execute a left merge with sales and managers to yield a new DataFrame sales_and_managers.
Use how='left', left_on=['city', 'state'], and right_on=['branch', 'state'].
Print the new DataFrame sales_and_managers. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result!

Solution:-
# Merge revenue and sales: revenue_and_sales
revenue_and_sales = pd.merge(revenue,sales ,how='right',on=['city','state'])

# Print revenue_and_sales
print(revenue_and_sales)

# Merge sales and managers: sales_and_managers
sales_and_managers = pd.merge(sales,managers,how='left',left_on=['city','state'],right_on=['branch','state'])

# Print sales_and_managers
print(sales_and_managers)

Q5:-
Merge sales_and_managers with revenue_and_sales. Store the result as merge_default.
Print merge_default. This has been done for you.
Merge sales_and_managers with revenue_and_sales using how='outer'. Store the result as merge_outer.
Print merge_outer. This has been done for you.
Merge sales_and_managers with revenue_and_sales only on ['city','state'] using an outer join. Store the result as merge_outer_on and hit 'Submit Answer' to see what the merged DataFrames look like!

Solution:-
# Perform the first merge: merge_default
merge_default = pd.merge(sales_and_managers,revenue_and_sales)

# Print merge_default
print(merge_default)

# Perform the second merge: merge_outer
merge_outer = pd.merge(sales_and_managers,revenue_and_sales,how='outer')

# Print merge_outer
print(merge_outer)

# Perform the third merge: merge_outer_on
merge_outer_on = pd.merge(sales_and_managers,revenue_and_sales,on=['city','state'],how='outer')

# Print merge_outer_on
print(merge_outer_on)

Q6:-
Perform an ordered merge on austin and houston using pd.merge_ordered(). Store the result as tx_weather.
Print tx_weather. You should notice that the rows are sorted by the date but it is not possible to tell which observation came from which city.
Perform another ordered merge on austin and houston.
This time, specify the keyword arguments on='date' and suffixes=['_aus','_hus'] so that the rows can be distinguished. Store the result as tx_weather_suff.
Print tx_weather_suff to examine its contents. This has been done for you.
Perform a third ordered merge on austin and houston.
This time, in addition to the on and suffixes parameters, specify the keyword argument fill_method='ffill' to use forward-filling to replace NaN entries with the most recent non-null entry, and hit 'Submit Answer' to examine the contents of the merged DataFrames!

Solution:-
# Perform the first ordered merge: tx_weather
tx_weather = pd.merge_ordered(austin,houston)

# Print tx_weather
print(tx_weather)

# Perform the second ordered merge: tx_weather_suff
tx_weather_suff = pd.merge_ordered(austin,houston,on='date',suffixes=['_aus','_hus'])

# Print tx_weather_suff
print(tx_weather_suff)

# Perform the third ordered merge: tx_weather_ffill
tx_weather_ffill = pd.merge_ordered(austin,houston,on='date',suffixes=['_aus','_hus'],fill_method='ffill')

# Print tx_weather_ffill
print(tx_weather_ffill)

Q7:-
Merge auto and oil using pd.merge_asof() with left_on='yr' and right_on='Date'. Store the result as merged.
Print the tail of merged. This has been done for you.
Resample merged using 'A' (annual frequency), and on='Date'. Select [['mpg','Price']] and aggregate the mean. Store the result as yearly.
Hit Submit Answer to examine the contents of yearly and yearly.corr(), which shows the Pearson correlation between the resampled 'Price' and 'mpg'.

Solution:-
# Merge auto and oil: merged
merged = pd.merge_asof(auto,oil,left_on='yr',right_on='Date')

# Print the tail of merged
print(merged.tail())

# Resample merged: yearly
yearly = merged.resample('A',on='Date')[['mpg','Price']].mean()

# Print yearly
print(yearly)

# print yearly.corr()
print(yearly.corr())
