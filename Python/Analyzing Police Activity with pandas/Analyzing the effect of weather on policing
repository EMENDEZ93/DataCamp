Q1:-
Read weather.csv into a DataFrame named weather.
Select the temperature columns (TMIN, TAVG, TMAX) and print their summary statistics using the .describe() method.
Create a box plot to visualize the temperature columns.
Display the plot.

Solution:-
# Read 'weather.csv' into a DataFrame named 'weather'
weather = pd.read_csv('weather.csv')

# Describe the temperature columns
print(weather[['TMIN', 'TAVG', 'TMAX']].describe())

# Create a box plot of the temperature columns
weather[['TMIN', 'TAVG', 'TMAX']].plot(kind='box')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Q2:-
Create a new column in the weather DataFrame named TDIFF that represents the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures.
Print the summary statistics for TDIFF using the .describe() method.
Create a histogram with 20 bins to visualize TDIFF.
Display the plot.

Solution:-
# Create a 'TDIFF' column that represents temperature difference
weather['TDIFF'] =weather.TMAX - weather.TMIN

# Describe the 'TDIFF' column
print(weather['TDIFF'].describe())

# Create a histogram with 20 bins to visualize 'TDIFF'
weather.TDIFF.plot(kind='hist',bins=20)

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Q3:-
Copy the columns WT01 through WT22 from weather to a new DataFrame named WT.
Calculate the sum of each row in WT, and store the results in a new weather column named bad_conditions.
Replace any missing values in bad_conditions with a 0. (This has been done for you.)
Create a histogram to visualize bad_conditions, and then display the plot.

Solution:-
# Copy 'WT01' through 'WT22' to a new DataFrame
WT = weather.loc[:,'WT01':'WT22']

# Calculate the sum of each row in 'WT'
weather['bad_conditions'] = WT.sum(axis='columns')

# Replace missing values in 'bad_conditions' with '0'
weather['bad_conditions'] = weather.bad_conditions.fillna(0).astype('int')

# Create a histogram to visualize 'bad_conditions'
weather.bad_conditions.plot(kind='hist')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

Q4:-
Count the unique values in the bad_conditions column and sort the index. (This has been done for you.)
Create a dictionary called mapping that maps the bad_conditions integers to strings as specified above.
Convert the bad_conditions integers to strings using the mapping and store the results in a new column called rating.
Count the unique values in rating to verify that the integers were properly converted to strings.

Solution:-
# Count the unique values in 'bad_conditions' and sort the index
print(weather.bad_conditions.value_counts().sort_index())

# Create a dictionary that maps integers to strings
mapping = {0:'good', 1:'bad', 2:'bad', 3:'bad',4:'bad',5:'worse',6:'worse',7:'worse',8:'worse',9:'worse'}

# Convert the 'bad_conditions' integers to strings using the 'mapping'
weather['rating'] = weather.bad_conditions.map(mapping)

# Count the unique values in 'rating'
print(weather.rating.value_counts())

Q5:-
Create a list object called cats that lists the weather ratings in a logical order: 'good', 'bad', 'worse'.
Change the data type of the rating column from object to category. Make sure to use the cats list to define the category ordering.
Examine the head of the rating column to confirm that the categories are logically ordered.

Solution:-
# Create a list of weather ratings in logical order
cats= ['good','bad','worse']

# Change the data type of 'rating' to category
weather['rating'] = weather['rating'].astype('category').cat.reorder_categories(cats, ordered=True)

# Examine the head of 'rating'
print(weather['rating'].head())

Q6:-
Reset the index of the ri DataFrame.
Examine the head of ri to verify that stop_datetime is now a DataFrame column, and the index is now the default integer index.
Create a new DataFrame named weather_rating that contains only the DATE and rating columns from the weather DataFrame.
Examine the head of weather_rating to verify that it contains the proper columns.

Solution:-
# Reset the index of 'ri'
ri.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Examine the head of 'ri'
print(ri.head())

# Create a DataFrame from the 'DATE' and 'rating' columns
weather_rating = weather[['DATE','rating']]

# Examine the head of 'weather_rating'
print(weather_rating.head())

Q7:-
Examine the shape of the ri DataFrame.
Merge the ri and weather_rating DataFrames using a left join.
Examine the shape of ri_weather to confirm that it has two more columns but the same number of rows as ri.
Replace the index of ri_weather with the stop_datetime column.

Solution:-
# Examine the shape of 'ri'
print(ri.shape)

# Merge 'ri' and 'weather_rating' using a left join
ri_weather = pd.merge(left=ri, right=weather_rating, left_on='stop_date', right_on='DATE', how='left')

# Examine the shape of 'ri_weather'
print(ri_weather.shape)

# Set 'stop_datetime' as the index of 'ri_weather'
ri_weather.set_index('stop_datetime', inplace=True)

Q8:-
Calculate the overall arrest rate by taking the mean of the is_arrested Series.

Solution:-
# Calculate the overall arrest rate
print(ri_weather.is_arrested.mean())

Q9:-
Calculate the arrest rate for each weather rating using a .groupby().

Solution:-
# Calculate the arrest rate for each 'rating'
print(ri_weather.groupby('rating').is_arrested.mean())

Q10:-
Calculate the arrest rate for each combination of violation and rating. How do the arrest rates differ by group?

Solution-
# Calculate the arrest rate for each 'violation' and 'rating'
print(ri_weather.groupby(['violation','rating']).is_arrested.mean())

Q11:-
Save the output of the .groupby() operation from the last exercise as a new object, arrest_rate. (This has been done for you.)
Print the arrest_rate Series and examine it.
Print the arrest rate for moving violations in bad weather.
Print the arrest rates for speeding violations in all three weather conditions.

Solution:-
# Save the output of the groupby operation from the last exercise
arrest_rate = ri_weather.groupby(['violation', 'rating']).is_arrested.mean()

# Print the 'arrest_rate' Series
print(arrest_rate)

# Print the arrest rate for moving violations in bad weather
print(arrest_rate.loc['Moving violation','bad'])

# Print the arrest rates for speeding violations in all three weather conditions
print(arrest_rate.loc['Speeding'])

Q12:-
Unstack the arrest_rate Series to reshape it into a DataFrame.
Create the exact same DataFrame using a pivot table! Each of the three .pivot_table() parameters should be specified as one of the ri_weather columns.

Solution:-
# Unstack the 'arrest_rate' Series into a DataFrame
print(arrest_rate.unstack())

# Create the same DataFrame using a pivot table
print(ri_weather.pivot_table(index='violation', columns=['rating'], values='is_arrested'))
