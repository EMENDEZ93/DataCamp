Q1:-
Extract the 'NOC' column from the DataFrame medals and assign the result to country_names. Notice that this Series has repeated entries for every medal (of any type) a country has won in any Edition of the Olympics.
Create a Series medal_counts by applying .value_counts() to the Series country_names.
Print the top 15 countries ranked by total number of medals won. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result.

Soltuion:-
# Select the 'NOC' column of medals: country_names
country_names = medals['NOC']

# Count the number of medals won by each country: medal_counts
medal_counts = country_names.value_counts()

# Print top 15 countries ranked by medals
print(medal_counts.head(15))

Q2:-
Construct a pivot table counted from the DataFrame medals aggregating by count. Use 'NOC' as the index, 'Athlete' for the values, and 'Medal' for the columns.
Modify the DataFrame counted by adding a column counted['totals']. The new column 'totals' should contain the result of taking the sum along the columns (i.e., use .sum(axis='columns')).
Overwrite the DataFrame counted by sorting it with the .sort_values() method. Specify the keyword argument ascending=False.
Print the first 15 rows of counted using .head(15). This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result.

Solution:-
# Construct the pivot table: counted
counted = medals.pivot_table(index='NOC', values='Athlete', columns='Medal', aggfunc='count')

# Create the new column: counted['totals']
counted['totals'] = counted.sum(axis='columns')

# Sort counted by the 'totals' column
counted = counted.sort_values('totals', ascending=False)

# Print the top 15 rows of counted
print(counted.head(15))

Q3:-
Select the columns 'Event_gender' and 'Gender'.
Create a dataframe ev_gen_uniques containing the unique pairs contained in ev_gen.
Print ev_gen_uniques. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result.

Solution:-
# Select columns: ev_gen
ev_gen = medals[['Event_gender','Gender']]

# Drop duplicate pairs: ev_gen_uniques
ev_gen_uniques = ev_gen.drop_duplicates()

# Print ev_gen_uniques
print(ev_gen_uniques)

Q4:-
Group medals by 'Event_gender' and 'Gender'.
Create a medal_count_by_gender DataFrame with a group count using the .count() method.
Print medal_count_by_gender. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to view the result.

Solution:-
# Group medals by the two columns: medals_by_gender
medals_by_gender = medals.groupby(['Event_gender','Gender'])

# Create a DataFrame with a group count: medal_count_by_gender
medal_count_by_gender = medals_by_gender.count()

# Print medal_count_by_gender
print(medal_count_by_gender)

Q5:-
Create a Boolean Series with a condition that captures the only row that has medals.Event_gender == 'W' and medals.Gender == 'Men'. Be sure to use the & operator.
Use the Boolean Series to create a DataFrame called suspect with the suspicious row.
Print suspect. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result.

Solution:-
# Create the Boolean Series: sus
sus = (medals.Event_gender == 'W') & (medals.Gender == 'Men')

# Create a DataFrame with the suspicious row: suspect
suspect = medals[sus]

# Print suspect
print(suspect)

Q6:-
Group medals by 'NOC'.
Compute the number of distinct sports in which each country won medals. To do this, select the 'Sport' column from country_grouped and apply .nunique().
Sort Nsports in descending order with .sort_values() and ascending=False.
Print the first 15 rows of Nsports. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result.

Solution:-
# Compute the number of distinct sports in which each country won medals: Nsports
Nsports = country_grouped['Sport'].nunique()

# Sort the values of Nsports in descending order
Nsports = Nsports.sort_values(ascending=False)

# Print the top 15 rows of Nsports
print(Nsports.head(15))

Q7:-
Using medals, create a Boolean Series called during_cold_war that is True when 'Edition' is >= 1952 and <= 1988.
Using medals, create a Boolean Series called is_usa_urs that is True when 'NOC' is either 'USA' or 'URS'.
Filter the medals DataFrame using during_cold_war and is_usa_urs to create a new DataFrame called cold_war_medals.
Group cold_war_medals by 'NOC'.
Create a Series Nsports from country_grouped using indexing & chained methods:
Extract the column 'Sport'.
Use .nunique() to get the number of unique elements in each group;
Apply .sort_values(ascending=False) to rearrange the Series.
Print the final Series Nsports. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result!

Solution:-
# Extract all rows for which the 'Edition' is between 1952 & 1988: during_cold_war
during_cold_war = (medals.Edition >= 1952) & (medals.Edition <= 1988)

# Extract rows for which 'NOC' is either 'USA' or 'URS': is_usa_urs
is_usa_urs = medals.NOC.isin(['USA','URS'])

# Use during_cold_war and is_usa_urs to create the DataFrame: cold_war_medals
cold_war_medals = medals.loc[during_cold_war & is_usa_urs]

# Group cold_war_medals by 'NOC'
country_grouped = cold_war_medals.groupby('NOC')

# Create Nsports
Nsports = country_grouped['Sport'].nunique().sort_values(ascending=False)

# Print Nsports
print(Nsports)

Q8:-
Construct medals_won_by_country using medals.pivot_table().
The index should be the years ('Edition') & the columns should be country ('NOC')
The values should be 'Athlete' (which captures every medal regardless of kind) & the aggregation method should be 'count' (which captures the total number of medals won).
Create cold_war_usa_urs_medals by slicing the pivot table medals_won_by_country. Your slice should contain the editions from years 1952:1988 and only the columns 'USA' & 'URS' from the pivot table.
Create the Series most_medals by applying the .idxmax() method to cold_war_usa_urs_medals. Be sure to use axis='columns'.
Print the result of applying .value_counts() to most_medals. The result reported gives the number of times each of the USA or the USSR won more Olympic medals in total than the other between 1952 and 1988.

Solution:-
# Create the pivot table: medals_won_by_country
medals_won_by_country = medals.pivot_table(index='Edition', columns='NOC',values='Athlete', aggfunc='count')

# Slice medals_won_by_country: cold_war_usa_urs_medals
cold_war_usa_urs_medals = medals_won_by_country.loc[1952:1988, ['USA','URS']]

# Create most_medals 
most_medals = cold_war_usa_urs_medals.idxmax(axis='columns')

# Print most_medals.value_counts()
print(most_medals.value_counts())

Q9:-
Create a DataFrame usa with data only for the USA.
Group usa such that ['Edition', 'Medal'] is the index. Aggregate the count over 'Athlete'.
Use .unstack() with level='Medal' to reshape the DataFrame usa_medals_by_year.
Construct a line plot from the final DataFrame usa_medals_by_year. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the plot!

Solution:-
# Create the DataFrame: usa
usa = medals[medals.NOC == 'USA']

# Group usa by ['Edition', 'Medal'] and aggregate over 'Athlete'
usa_medals_by_year = usa.groupby(['Edition','Medal'])['Athlete'].count()

# Reshape usa_medals_by_year by unstacking
usa_medals_by_year = usa_medals_by_year.unstack(level='Medal')

# Plot the DataFrame usa_medals_by_year
usa_medals_by_year.plot()
plt.show()

Q10:-
Create an area plot of usa_medals_by_year. This can be done by using .plot.area().

Solution:-
# Create the DataFrame: usa
usa = medals[medals.NOC == 'USA']

# Group usa by 'Edition', 'Medal', and 'Athlete'
usa_medals_by_year = usa.groupby(['Edition', 'Medal'])['Athlete'].count()

# Reshape usa_medals_by_year by unstacking
usa_medals_by_year = usa_medals_by_year.unstack(level='Medal')

# Create an area plot of usa_medals_by_year
usa_medals_by_year.plot.area()
plt.show()

Q11:-
Redefine the 'Medal' column of the DataFrame medals as an ordered categorical. To do this, use pd.Categorical() with three keyword arguments:
values = medals.Medal.
categories=['Bronze', 'Silver', 'Gold'].
ordered=True.
After this, you can verify that the type has changed using medals.info().
Plot the final DataFrame usa_medals_by_year as an area plot. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see how the plot has changed!

Solution:-
# Redefine 'Medal' as an ordered categorical
medals.Medal = pd.Categorical(values=medals.Medal, categories=['Bronze','Silver','Gold'],ordered=True)

# Create the DataFrame: usa
usa = medals[medals.NOC == 'USA']

# Group usa by 'Edition', 'Medal', and 'Athlete'
usa_medals_by_year = usa.groupby(['Edition', 'Medal'])['Athlete'].count()

# Reshape usa_medals_by_year by unstacking
usa_medals_by_year = usa_medals_by_year.unstack(level='Medal')
