Q1:-
Rename the university_shortname column to university_id in professors

Solution:-
-- Rename the university_shortname column
ALTER TABLE professors
rename column university_shortname to university_id;

Q2:-
Add a foreign key on university_id column in professors that references the id column in universities.
Name this foreign key professors_fkey.

Solution:-
-- Rename the university_shortname column
ALTER TABLE professors
RENAME COLUMN university_shortname TO university_id;

-- Add a foreign key on professors referencing universities
alter table professors 
add constraint professors_fkey FOREIGN KEY (university_id) REFERENCES universities (id);

Q3:-
Run the sample code and have a look at the error message.
What's wrong? Correct the university_id so that it actually reflects where Albert Einstein wrote his dissertation and became a professor â€“ at the University of Zurich (UZH)!

Solution:-
-- Try to insert a new professor
INSERT INTO professors (firstname, lastname, university_id)
VALUES ('Albert', 'Einstein', 'UZH');

Q4:-
JOIN professors with universities on professors.university_id = universities.id, i.e., retain all records where the foreign key of professors is equal to the primary key of universities.
Filter for university_city = 'Zurich'.

Solution:-
-- Select all professors working for universities in the city of Zurich
SELECT professors.lastname, universities.id, universities.university_city
from professors
join universities
ON professors.university_id = universities.id
where universities.university_city = 'Zurich';

Q5:-
Add a professor_id column with integer data type to affiliations, and declare it to be a foreign key that references the id column in professors.

Solution:-
-- Add a professor_id column
alter table affiliations
add COLUMN professor_id integer REFERENCES professors (id);

Q6:-
Rename the organization column in affiliations to organization_id.

solution:-
-- Add a professor_id column
ALTER TABLE affiliations
ADD COLUMN professor_id integer REFERENCES professors (id);

-- Rename the organization column to organization_id
alter table affiliations
rename organization TO organization_id;

Q7:-
Add a foreign key constraint on organization_id so that it references the id column in organizations.

Solution:-
-- Add a professor_id column
ALTER TABLE affiliations
ADD COLUMN professor_id integer REFERENCES professors (id);

-- Rename the organization column to organization_id
ALTER TABLE affiliations
RENAME organization TO organization_id;

-- Add a foreign key on organization_id
ALTER TABLE affiliations
ADD CONSTRAINT affiliations_organization_fkey foreign key (organization_id) references organizations (id);

Q8:-
Update the professor_id column with the corresponding value of the id column in professors.
"Corresponding" means rows in professors where the firstname and lastname are identical to the ones in affiliations.

Solution:-
-- Set professor_id to professors.id where firstname, lastname correspond to rows in professors
UPDATE affiliations
SET professor_id = professors.id
FROM professors
WHERE affiliations.firstname = professors.firstname AND affiliations.lastname = professors.lastname;

Q9:-
Drop the firstname and lastname columns from the affiliations table.

Solution:-
-- Drop the firstname column
alter table affiliations
DROP column firstname;

-- Drop the lastname column
alter table affiliations
drop column lastname;

Q10:-
Delete the affiliations_organization_id_fkey foreign key constraint in affiliations.

Solution:-
