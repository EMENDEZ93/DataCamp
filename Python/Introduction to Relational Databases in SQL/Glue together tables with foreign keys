Q1:-
Rename the university_shortname column to university_id in professors

Solution:-
-- Rename the university_shortname column
ALTER TABLE professors
rename column university_shortname to university_id;

Q2:-
Add a foreign key on university_id column in professors that references the id column in universities.
Name this foreign key professors_fkey.

Solution:-
-- Rename the university_shortname column
ALTER TABLE professors
RENAME COLUMN university_shortname TO university_id;

-- Add a foreign key on professors referencing universities
alter table professors 
add constraint professors_fkey FOREIGN KEY (university_id) REFERENCES universities (id);

Q3:-
Run the sample code and have a look at the error message.
What's wrong? Correct the university_id so that it actually reflects where Albert Einstein wrote his dissertation and became a professor â€“ at the University of Zurich (UZH)!

Solution:-
-- Try to insert a new professor
INSERT INTO professors (firstname, lastname, university_id)
VALUES ('Albert', 'Einstein', 'UZH');

Q4:-
JOIN professors with universities on professors.university_id = universities.id, i.e., retain all records where the foreign key of professors is equal to the primary key of universities.
Filter for university_city = 'Zurich'.

Solution:-
-- Select all professors working for universities in the city of Zurich
SELECT professors.lastname, universities.id, universities.university_city
from professors
join universities
ON professors.university_id = universities.id
where universities.university_city = 'Zurich';
