Q1:-
Import create_engine from sqlalchemy.
Create an engine to the census database by concatenating the following strings:
'postgresql+psycopg2://'
'student:datacamp'
'@postgresql.csrrinzqubik.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com'
':5432/census'
Use the .table_names() method on engine to print the table names.

Solution:-
# Import create_engine function
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create an engine to the census database
engine = create_engine('postgresql+psycopg2://student:datacamp@postgresql.csrrinzqubik.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/census')

# Use the .table_names() method on the engine to print the table names
print(engine.table_names())

Q2:-
Select all records from the census table by passing in census as a list to select().
Append a where clause to stmt to return only the records with a state of 'New York'.
Execute the statement stmt using .execute() and retrieve the results using .fetchall().
Iterate over results and print the age, sex and pop2008 columns from each record. For example, you can print out the age of result with result.age.

Solution:-
# Create a select query: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Add a where clause to filter the results to only those for New York
stmt = stmt.where(census.columns.state=='New York')

# Execute the query to retrieve all the data returned: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Loop over the results and print the age, sex, and pop2008
for result in results:
    print(result.age, result.sex, result.pop2008)

Q3:-
Select all records from the census table by passing it in as a list to select().
Append a where clause to return all the records with a state in the states list. Use in_(states) on census.columns.state to do this.
Loop over the ResultProxy connection.execute(stmt) and print the state and pop2000 columns from each record.

Solution:-
# Create a query for the census table: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Append a where clause to match all the states in_ the list states
stmt = stmt.where(census.columns.state.in_(states))

# Loop over the ResultProxy and print the state and its population in 2000
for rec in connection.execute(stmt):
    print(rec.state, rec.pop2000)

Q4:-
Import and_ from the sqlalchemy module.
Select all records from the census table.
Append a where clause to filter all the records whose state is 'California', and whose sex is not 'M'.
Iterate over the ResultProxy and print the age and sex columns from each record.

Solution:-
# Import and_
from sqlalchemy import and_

# Build a query for the census table: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Append a where clause to select only non-male records from California using and_
stmt = stmt.where(
    # The state of California with a non-male sex
    and_(census.columns.state == 'California',
         census.columns.sex != 'M'
         )
)

# Loop over the ResultProxy printing the age and sex
for r in connection.execute(stmt):
    print(r.age, r.sex)

Q5:-
Select all records of the state column from the census table. To do this, pass census.columns.state as a list to select().
Append an .order_by() to sort the result output by the state column.
Execute stmt using the .execute() method on connection and retrieve all the results using .fetchall().
Print the first 10 rows of results.

Solution:-
# Build a query to select the state column: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state])

# Order stmt by the state column
stmt = stmt.order_by(census.columns.state)

# Execute the query and store the results: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print the first 10 results
print(results[:10])

Q6:-
Import desc from the sqlalchemy module.
Select all records of the state column from the census table.
Append an .order_by() to sort the result output by the state column in descending order. Save the result as rev_stmt.
Execute rev_stmt using connection.execute() and fetch all the results with .fetchall(). Save them as rev_results.
Print the first 10 rows of rev_results.

Solution:-
# Import desc
from sqlalchemy import desc

# Build a query to select the state column: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state])

# Order stmt by state in descending order: rev_stmt
rev_stmt = stmt.order_by(desc(census.columns.state))

# Execute the query and store the results: rev_results
rev_results = connection.execute(rev_stmt).fetchall()

# Print the first 10 rev_results
print(rev_results[:10])

Q7:-
Select all records of the state and age columns from the census table.
Use .order_by() to sort the output of the state column in ascending order and age in descending order. (NOTE: desc is already imported).
Execute stmt using the .execute() method on connection and retrieve all the results using .fetchall().
Print the first 20 results.

Solution:-
# Build a query to select state and age: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state, census.columns.age])

# Append order by to ascend by state and descend by age
stmt = stmt.order_by(census.columns.state, desc(census.columns.age))

# Execute the statement and store all the records: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print the first 20 results
print(results[:20])

Q8:-
Build a select statement to count the distinct values in the state field of census.
Execute stmt to get the count and store the results as distinct_state_count.
Print the value of distinct_state_count.

Solution:-
