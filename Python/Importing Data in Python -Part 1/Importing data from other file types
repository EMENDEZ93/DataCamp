Q1:-
Import the pickle package.
Complete the second argument of open() so that it is read only for a binary file. This argument will be a string of two letters, one signifying 'read only', the other 'binary'.
Pass the correct argument to pickle.load(); it should use the variable that is bound to open.
Print the data, d.
Print the datatype of d; take your mind back to your previous use of the function type().

Solution:-
# Import pickle package
import pickle

# Open pickle file and load data: d
with open('data.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    d = pickle.load(file)

# Print d
print(d)

# Print datatype of d
print(type(d))

# Print sheet names
print(xl.sheet_names)
