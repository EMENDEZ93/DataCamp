Q1:-
Open the file moby_dick.txt as read-only and store it in the variable file. Make sure to pass the filename enclosed in quotation marks ''.
Print the contents of the file to the shell using the print() function. As Hugo showed in the video, you'll need to apply the method read() to the object file.
Check whether the file is closed by executing print(file.closed).
Close the file using the close() method.
Check again that the file is closed as you did above.

Solution:-
# Open a file: file
file = open("moby_dick.txt","r")

# Print it
print(file.read())

# Check whether file is closed
print(file.closed)

# Close file
file.close()

# Check whether file is closed
print(file.closed)

Q2:-
Open moby_dick.txt using the with context manager and the variable file.
Print the first three lines of the file to the shell by using readline() three times within the context manager.

Solution:-
# Read & print the first 3 lines
with open('moby_dick.txt') as file:
    print(file.readline())
    print(file.readline())
    print(file.readline())

Q3:-
Fill in the arguments of np.loadtxt() by passing file and a comma ',' for the delimiter.
Fill in the argument of print() to print the type of the object digits. Use the function type().
Execute the rest of the code to visualize one of the rows of the data.

Solution:-
# Import package
import numpy as np

# Assign filename to variable: file
file = 'digits.csv'

# Load file as array: digits
digits = np.loadtxt(file, delimiter=',')

# Print datatype of digits
print(type(digits))

# Select and reshape a row
im = digits[21, 1:]
im_sq = np.reshape(im, (28, 28))

# Plot reshaped data (matplotlib.pyplot already loaded as plt)
plt.imshow(im_sq, cmap='Greys', interpolation='nearest')
plt.show()

Q4:-
Complete the arguments of np.loadtxt(): the file you're importing is tab-delimited, you want to skip the first row and you only want to import the first and third columns.
Complete the argument of the print() call in order to print the entire array that you just imported.

Solution:-
# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Assign the filename: file
file = 'digits_header.txt'

# Load the data: data
data = np.loadtxt(file, delimiter='\t', skiprows=1, usecols=[0,2])

# Print data
print(data)

Q5:-
Complete the first call to np.loadtxt() by passing file as the first argument.
Execute print(data[0]) to print the first element of data.
Complete the second call to np.loadtxt(). The file you're importing is tab-delimited, the datatype is float, and you want to skip the first row.
Print the 10th element of data_float by completing the print() command. Be guided by the previous print() call.
Execute the rest of the code to visualize the data.

Solution:-
# Assign filename: file
file = 'seaslug.txt'

# Import file: data
data = np.loadtxt(file, delimiter='\t', dtype=str)

# Print the first element of data
print(data[0])

# Import data as floats and skip the first row: data_float
data_float = np.loadtxt(file, delimiter='\t', dtype=float, skiprows=1)

# Print the 10th element of data_float
print(data_float[9])

# Plot a scatterplot of the data
plt.scatter(data_float[:, 0], data_float[:, 1])
plt.xlabel('time (min.)')
plt.ylabel('percentage of larvae')
plt.show()
